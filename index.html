    <p> In September 2002, University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) was established by merging The Institute of Computer Technology (ICT Ordinance 1987.09.21) and The Department of Computer Science both of the University of Colombo, as the first centre of higher learning of computing in Sri Lanka. The number of students admitted to these programmes may be increased in the coming years. A total of 200 students were admitted by the three M.Sc programmes in Computer Science, Information Technology and Advanced Computing which started in the year 2002. Computer Science course modules are also conducted for first, second, third and fourth year students of the Physical and Bio Science streams of the Faculty of Science, University of Colombo.
